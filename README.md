## Module_11_Homework Summary of Findings
For the search trends, it seems that the marketing team can make the most use of this data. The search trends have a specific time pattern that can be clearly seen and analyzed. As far as the stock price data, there seems to be a pretty negligible correlation between the search trends and stock price. The only time you can see a similarity is during the pandemic months, which would make sense since everything was affected during that time. 

Lastly, the Prophet model was interesting since it predicted a trend down in searches. Only time will tell if this is correctly predicted or not.
